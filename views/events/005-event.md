Let's meetup again and bring this community back on track again. The JS related topic for this meetup is not yet determined and will be announced later. Since Canadian Tire established their new data centre and design studio in Winnipeg, they have been planning to help build a stronger User Groups community and decided to join Winnipeg.js. At this meetup, Adam Merrifield and Craig Haney from the Canadian Tire Innovations in Kitchener will talk about their vision for Winnipeg's developer community and Canadian Tire's new design studio. There will probably be one or two speakers at the event presenting some JS related topics. If anybody would like to present something that is JS related, please let us know. You can contact us on Twitter or via email. We hope to see everybody again at this event ... share our experiences, catch up and have simply fun hanging out. And, of course, food and beverages will be provided, as always.
