![CoffeeScript](/images/coffeescript-logo.png "CoffeeScript")
CoffeeScript is a small language that compiles to Javascript that aims to solve many of the short comings of javascript (the bad parts). It makes it easier to write less code that does more in a simple and elegant way.

Kevin Quiring will be talking about CoffeeScript and how his team at Winnipeg Transit is using it to help them solve real problems. Problems that would otherwise require nasty hacks if they were written in plain javascript. He will also touch base on the criticism around coffee and why you should use it in your next project.
