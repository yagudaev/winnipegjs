Microsoft <3 JavaScript
-----------------------
Microsoft has been typically seen as this big, evil, restrictive, prescriptive company that is entirely
anti-open source. But oh how the times have changed! Microsoft has embraced open source JavaScript frameworks
as part of their web stack, improved tooling support to better support JavaScript, and even made available
an object-oriented JavaScript library called TypeScript. In this session I'll walk you through the *new*
Microsoft and show you how they're being good neighbors in the JavaScript community.

Introduction to Angular and Breeze
----------------------------------

Learn the fundamentals of AngularJS and watch as I build a sample application using AngularJS, Breeze.js,
and Hot Towel all within Visual Studio!

### About the Speaker

Mike Sigsworth is a consultant from Online Business Systems with over 7 years of experience working with
ASP.NET and C#. When he's not chasing around his two-year old son, he can be found in front of his laptop
working and/or playing with some manner of code, which has lately been a whole lot of Angular.
