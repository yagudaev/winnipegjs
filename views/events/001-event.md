We decided to do our first about one of the hottest topics in the web development world, Node.js.

We will start with a quick introduction to Node.js and then go over a few uses of Node.js and when not to use it. We will then dive into a few popular frameworks and see what each is good for and which you should use for your projects.

Note: the exact topics will be subject to change due to time and other considerations. If you have other ideas for talks, or want to tell us what we *must* cover contact us on twitter [@winnipegjs](http://www.twitter.com/winnipegjs).

Remeber to RSVP to the event if you are planning on attending. Hope to see you all there!
