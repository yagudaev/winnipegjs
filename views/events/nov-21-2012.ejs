				Phonegap is a platform that bridges the shortcomings of standard mobile web 
				and native applications. It provides a standard API and tools to produce a 
				compiled native application, while still using Javascript as our language of choice. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mobile device usage has grown at an incredible pace, both in developed and 
				developing countries. The opportunities within this mobile space are huge, 
				however, the fast differences between the environment and languages for 
				each platform introduces many challenges. Mobile Web applications provide 
				us with most of the tools and Phonegap gets us the rest of the way. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We will first discuss Mobile Web, see how far its come and see a simple 
				demonstration of what it can do.  Then, we will move onto Phonegap, 
				what problems it solves, how it can be extended and some caveats of the platform.
