2. Go to the project directory `cd winnipegjs`
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`

Run
===

Simply run as a normal node application by using `npm start`.

Remember that Markdown views get cached on application startup, therefore you will need to restart the application when you make changes. `Nodemon` is designed to do it for you if you run `npm start`. Otherwise stop and start the server between changes to the .md files.
